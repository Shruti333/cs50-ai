i started with writing the basic code but was facing a little bit of problems with tensorflow but with a little help from how to operate tensorflow and openCV and a little practice i was able to write the code correctly .Then again while  running the code 
there was problems with tensorflow versions .Now ultimately i have done every correcton needed and m code is finally working.
